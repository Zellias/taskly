Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Flet (`pip install flet`)
- SQLite3 (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Zellias/taskly.git
   cd taskly

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install flet

3. Run the app:
   python taskly.py

Usage:
Once you run the application, you'll see a window with columns for different task statuses:

- Not Started: Tasks that are yet to begin.
